# Homework #2

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* for loop - 
		We use for loops in coding to look at each item in a list. Say we had a list of numbers 1,2,3,4,5. Now say we wanted to multiply each number in the list 
		by two. We could write out code for each position, or we could just use a for loop to accomplish the same thing. This comes in very handy when we do not 	
		know how long the list is. We can essentially just say for each item in the list do something to it. 

	* && || ! - 
		These are special charecters used in javascript coding. The && is used instead of the word 'and'. The || is used instead of the word 'or'. 
		Finally the ! charecter is used instead of saying the word 'not'. These type of operators are used in comparisons mainly. When we want to 
		check if two thing are true we would say: if this && that are true. Same goes for checking if one thing is true we say: if this || that is true.
		To check if something is not equal we do like this: is 1 != 2.

	* Array -
		An array is basically another name for a list. Arrays can hold multiple different items such as strings or numbers. 

	* git -
		Git is a program you can run on your computer to help manage coding projects. You can use Git from the command line on the computer to interact
		with files associated with programming projects you are working on. It can handle small and large projects alike. 

	* GitHub -
		Github is a website where you can store your coding projects. Other people can make copies of the project. This allows large teams to work on a single 
		project. Each person can download a copy, do their work, and upload it back to the site. The site automatically looks for issues between the different
		uploaded files from the workers. 


2. Install git.  https://git-scm.com/downloads


3. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
	* git push origin master


4. Make the tests pass!
